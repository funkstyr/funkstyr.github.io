*This is Part 6 of a series on plan-based development with Claude Code. Today we explore how Claude Code becomes an integrated development partner.*

<br />

## From Chatbot to Development Partner

<br />

Claude Code isn't a chatbot you occasionally ask questions. It's an integrated development partner that understands your codebase, follows your patterns, and executes multi-step tasks.

<br />

The difference is profound:
- **Chat**: "How do I add a new route in Express?"
- **Claude Code**: "Add a new protected route for user preferences following our existing patterns in `@bts/api`"

<br />

## Custom Commands: Codified Workflows

<br />

We created custom commands that encode our team's workflows:

<br />

```
.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── research.md   # /research - Research & planning
│   ├── understand.md # /understand - Code comprehension
│   ├── find.md       # /find - Code discovery
│   ├── test.md       # /test - Testing workflow
│   ├── review.md     # /review - PR-style code review
│   └── write.md      # /write - Code generation
```

<br />

### The `/research` Command

<br />

When planning a new feature:

<br />

```
/research add real-time notifications to the dashboard
```

<br />

This triggers a structured research process:
1. Searches for existing notification patterns
2. Reviews the current architecture
3. Identifies affected packages
4. Produces a structured implementation plan

<br />

### The `/review` Command

<br />

Before committing:

<br />

```
/review staged
```

<br />

This performs a comprehensive code review:
- Checks for bugs and security issues
- Validates TypeScript patterns
- Ensures consistency with repo conventions
- Suggests improvements

<br />

## Skills: Context-Aware Assistance

<br />

Unlike commands that you invoke explicitly, skills activate automatically based on context:

<br />

```markdown
# .claude/skills/type-safety/SKILL.md

## When to Activate
- Questions about TypeScript errors
- Code with type assertions or `any`
- Discussions of validation or schemas

## Guidance
- Prefer Zod schemas over manual type guards
- Use branded types for IDs
- Validate at system boundaries
```

<br />

When Claude sees code with `as any`, it automatically applies the type-safety skill's guidance.

<br />

## The Plan Mode Workflow

<br />

For complex features, we use Claude Code's plan mode:

<br />

1. **Enter plan mode**: Triggered for multi-step implementations
2. **Explore codebase**: Claude reads relevant files, understands patterns
3. **Write plan**: Creates detailed implementation steps
4. **Review**: Human reviews and approves the plan
5. **Execute**: Claude implements following the approved plan

<br />

This mirrors our manual plan-based development but with AI assistance at every step.

<br />

## Real Examples from Our Workflow

<br />

**Example 1: Fixing a Build Issue**

<br />

```
> bun run dev shows "Cannot find module '@bts/effect/services'"

Claude analyzes:
- Checks turbo.json for task dependencies
- Identifies race condition: dev starts before build completes
- Proposes fix: Add "^build" to dev task dependencies
- Implements the fix
- Verifies with test run
```

<br />

**Example 2: Adding a New Package**

<br />

```
> Create a new @bts/highlighter-router package following existing patterns

Claude:
- Uses `turbo gen package` generator
- Creates turbo.json with correct tags
- Sets up tsconfig.json extending base
- Adds to workspace catalog
- Creates initial exports
- Updates @bts/router to include new router
```

<br />

## The Amplification Effect

<br />

Claude Code doesn't replace developer judgment—it amplifies it.

<br />

- **Without Claude**: Manually search 60 packages, copy patterns, adapt to context
- **With Claude**: Describe intent, review proposed solution, approve and refine

<br />

The cognitive load shifts from "how do I do this?" to "is this the right approach?"
