          Hi! I'm Michael, a fullstack developer with a passion for building
          scalable, user-focused applications. I specialize in React and the
          modern JavaScript ecosystem, with experience across the full stack.
        </p>
        <p class='text-muted-foreground'>
          Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Highlight, where I build
          AI-powered features, architect monorepo solutions, and help teams ship
          code with confidence. I love working in fast-paced environments where
          quality and velocity go hand-in-hand.

            Designing APIs and services with .NET Core, Node.js, and modern
            cloud platforms. I enjoy working with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to

            Improving workflows through monorepo architecture, CI/CD pipelines,
