*This is Part 7 of our series on plan-based development with Claude Code. Today we put it all together and share lessons from six months of this workflow.*

<br />

## The Complete Workflow

<br />

Here's how all these pieces combine for a typical feature:

<br />

### Step 1: Planning

<br />

1. **Create plan document**: Write `plans/feature-user-preferences.md`
2. **Use `/research`**: Let Claude explore the codebase and validate approach
3. **Define scope**: List affected packages and implementation steps

<br />

### Step 2: Implementation

<br />

1. **Start with types**: Define the data shapes
2. **Write failing tests**: TDD where appropriate
3. **Implement incrementally**: Check each step with `bun run check-types`
4. **Use `/write`**: Let Claude generate boilerplate following patterns
5. **Verify continuously**: Fast Turborepo caches make this painless

<br />

### Step 3: Polish & Ship

<br />

1. **Run full test suite**: `bun run test`
2. **Use `/review`**: Get AI code review before human review
3. **Update plan**: Mark completed steps, document decisions
4. **Create PR**: Include link to plan document
5. **CI validates**: Turborepo ensures only affected tests run
6. **Review is fast**: Reviewer reads plan, understands intent
7. **Merge confidently**: Type system caught edge cases

<br />

## Why This Works

<br />

The workflow creates positive reinforcement loops:

<br />

```
Fast Type Checking → More Frequent Checking → Earlier Bug Detection
       ↓
Strict Types → Better IDE Support → Faster Coding
       ↓
Good Tests → Confident Refactoring → Cleaner Code
       ↓
Clean Code → Easier AI Understanding → Better AI Assistance
       ↓
AI Assistance → Faster Feature Delivery → More Time for Quality
       ↓
Back to start...
```

<br />

Each investment pays dividends that make the next investment easier.

<br />

## The Compound Returns

<br />

Over six months, we've observed:

<br />

- **50% reduction** in time from idea to PR
- **70% reduction** in PR revision cycles
- **80% reduction** in production bugs from type errors
- **90% reduction** in "it works on my machine" issues

<br />

These aren't from any single practice—they're from the compound effect of all practices reinforcing each other.

<br />

## What We Got Right

<br />

**1. Invest in tooling early**

Setting up Turborepo properly, creating shared configs, and establishing patterns paid dividends for months.

<br />

**2. Make the right thing the easy thing**

Generators for new packages, shared TypeScript configs, and custom Claude commands mean developers naturally follow patterns.

<br />

**3. Document decisions, not just code**

Our `plans/` directory is as valuable as our `src/` directories for understanding the codebase.

<br />

**4. Embrace AI as a collaborator**

Claude Code is most effective when treated as a knowledgeable team member, not a magic code generator.

<br />

## What We'd Do Differently

<br />

**1. Start stricter, loosen if needed**

We initially had loose TypeScript settings and tightened over time. This created migration debt. Start strict.

<br />

**2. Establish package boundaries from day one**

Turborepo boundaries work best when introduced before bad patterns exist, not after.

<br />

**3. Write plans for everything initially**

Even when it felt like overkill, plans for "simple" features prevented scope creep and provided documentation.

<br />

## Best Practices Checklist

<br />

For teams adopting this workflow:

<br />

- [ ] Enable TypeScript strict mode across all packages
- [ ] Configure Turborepo with explicit task dependencies
- [ ] Create a `plans/` directory and use it
- [ ] Set up shared test configurations that prioritize speed
- [ ] Install Claude Code and create custom commands for your workflows
- [ ] Add `bun run check && bun run check-types` to your post-change ritual
- [ ] Make CI fast enough that developers don't skip it
- [ ] Document your patterns in a `CLAUDE.md` or similar file

<br />

## The Shift in Development Mindset

<br />

This workflow represents a shift from reactive to proactive development:

<br />

**Old mindset**: Code first, fix problems as they arise, document if time permits.

<br />

**New mindset**: Plan first, let tooling catch problems early, documentation is part of the process.

<br />

The result isn't just faster feature delivery—it's sustainable velocity. We ship faster today without borrowing against tomorrow's productivity.

<br />

## Getting Started

<br />

If you're inspired to try this approach:

<br />

1. **Start with TypeScript strict mode**: The foundation for everything else
2. **Add Turborepo**: Even for small monorepos, the structure helps
3. **Create your first plan document**: For your next feature
4. **Try Claude Code**: With access to your codebase
5. **Iterate**: Adjust the workflow to fit your team

<br />

The specific tools matter less than the principles:
- Write before you code
- Verify continuously
- Trust your type system
- Leverage AI assistance

<br />

These principles compound over time, making each week of development more productive than the last.

*But there's one piece we haven't covered yet: how do you test AI-powered features? Traditional unit tests don't work when outputs are non-deterministic. In Part 8, we'll explore Evalite and the emerging world of LLM evaluation frameworks.*
