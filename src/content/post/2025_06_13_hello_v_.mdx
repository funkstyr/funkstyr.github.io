This is at least the third time I have boot up my personal site. Which probably 
means there was at least another 10 attempts where the project started but never 
made it to a deployed state. The first time was after my first couple of months 
at my first salaried software position. Don't think I have touched Ruby(Jekyll) 
since.

<br />

That was almost 10 years ago. I was working in a .Net shop on a team creating 
Window's background services to ingest our client's telephony agent and call events. 
Attempting to learn web development through Angular 2 beta on the side after hours 
and struggling. For some reason I wasn't clicking and every other week something changed.

<br />

After a couple months of continuing to struggle every release, I became familiar with 
React as the team next to us was in charge of a new web app. I eventually went home one 
of the nights and decided to get a Udemy course; the rest was history from there. I 
have been working on mostly React ever since outside of a short stint with Angular 1.x.
