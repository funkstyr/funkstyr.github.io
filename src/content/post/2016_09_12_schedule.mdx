# Sorry, Not Sorry

<br/>

It has been awhile since I have been active on giving back; 
I have been busy with work, and honestly a little fed up with the Angular release candidate. 
I gave it time to mature but every new iteration just ended up causing breaking changes. 
This can lead to a big challenge, one that is hard to back away from. 

<br/>

But, I a have limited time to try and learn something after putting in a full day's of work in and trying to learn and trouble shoot problems. 
After talking to a coworker in another team it got me looking into React.js. I still have the goals of turning what I do for budgeting and inventory management with excel into a web app; I also want to try and create a business dashboard app trying to include majority of what I did during my business curriculum.

<br/>

Some have said it takes about a month to create a new habit. 
So now I am going to try and create a schedule that is flexible to create this new habit of learning web applications. 
I have also bough 3 courses at Udemy to help accomplish this. 
I figure with spending money causes me to have skin in the game and I do not want to waste money. 
I also still need to read my books on coding and continue reading and expanding my vernacular to greater ends.

## New Beginnings 

<br/>

#### Monday to Friday

<br/>

<br/>

Hopefully this schedule is enough for me to relax, and flexible enough for me to stick to it. 
Ever since I have attended Cal Hacks in Fall 2015 I have been interested in web applications and single page applications mainly focusing on angular at the time. 
As of now I plan on doing a daily blog recapping what I have read and what I have learned from that days post work journey.

After going through my Udemy courses, online tutorials, and business applications; 
I will focus on switching this site over to react with markdown management like jeklyll.
